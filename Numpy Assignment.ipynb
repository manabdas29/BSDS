    "'''Broadcasting in NumPy is a powerful mechanism that allows arrays of different shapes to be combined in arithmetic operations. When you perform operations on arrays with different shapes, NumPy automatically \"broadcasts\" the arrays to make their shapes compatible for the operation. This broadcasting behavior eliminates the need for explicit loops and simplifies the syntax of array operations.\n",
