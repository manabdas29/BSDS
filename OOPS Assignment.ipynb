    "1. Reusability: Inheritance allows the child class to inherit the attributes and methods of the parent class, reducing code duplication and promoting reusability.\n",

    "2. Extensibility: It enables the creation of new classes that are built upon existing classes, allowing for the extension of functionality without modifying the original class.\n",

    "3. Modularity: Inheritance promotes modularity by organizing classes into a hierarchy, making it easier to manage and maintain code.\n",

    "1. **Public Access Modifier**: \n",
    "   - In Python, all attributes and methods are public by default.\n",
    "   - Public members can be accessed from inside the class, from outside the class, and even from subclasses.\n",
    "   - Public members are typically accessed directly without any restrictions.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Private members are indicated by prefixing the attribute or method name with double underscores (__).\n",
    "   - Private members are not accessible from outside the class where they are defined.\n",

    "   - Protected members can be accessed from within the class where they are defined and also from subclasses.\n",
    "   - There is no strict enforcement of protected access in Python, but it is a convention to indicate that a member should be treated as protected.\n",

    "\n",
    "It's important to note that in Python, these access modifiers are mainly conventions and not strictly enforced like in some other programming languages. Developers are expected to follow these conventions to indicate the intended visibility of class members.\n",

    "#9. Explain the significance of encapsulation in achieving abstraction. Provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "'''Encapsulation and abstraction are closely related concepts in object-oriented programming, with encapsulation playing a significant role in achieving abstraction. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. By encapsulating data and methods within a class, we can control access to the data and hide the internal implementation details, which is crucial for achieving abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how encapsulation contributes to achieving abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows us to hide the internal state of an object (attributes) by making them private or protected. This means that the data can only be accessed and modified through the methods provided by the class, thereby hiding the implementation details from external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction through Interface: Encapsulation provides an interface to interact with objects by exposing public methods while keeping the internal details hidden. This separation between interface and implementation allows us to achieve abstraction by defining a clear interface for interacting with objects without exposing how the functionality is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlled Access: Encapsulation allows us to control access to data by providing getter and setter methods to read and modify attributes. This control ensures that data is accessed and modified in a controlled manner, helping in maintaining data integrity and enforcing constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Modularity: Encapsulation promotes code modularity by bundling related data and methods together within a class. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and maintain code, as changes can be localized within the class without affecting other parts of the program.\n",

    "#20. Describe the concept of method abstraction in Python and how it relates to polymorphism.\n",
    "'''Method abstraction in Python involves defining methods in a way that their specific implementation details are hidden from the user, focusing instead on what the method does rather than how it does it. This concept is closely related to polymorphism, a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In method abstraction:\n",
    "- Methods are defined in classes with a clear purpose or behavior, without revealing the internal implementation details.\n",
    "- Users interact with objects through these methods, relying on the method's defined interface and behavior without needing to know how it is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism, on the other hand, allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. This is achieved through method overriding, where subclasses provide their own implementation of a method defined in a superclass. The same method name can behave differently based on the object it is called on, enabling flexibility and extensibility in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method abstraction and polymorphism are related in the following ways:\n",
    "- Method abstraction provides a way to define common interfaces for classes, promoting polymorphism by allowing different objects to respond to the same method call in a way that is appropriate for their specific class.\n",
    "- Polymorphism relies on method abstraction to define methods in a superclass that can be overridden by subclasses, enabling objects of different classes to exhibit different behaviors while being treated uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining method abstraction and polymorphism, developers can create flexible and extensible code that promotes code reuse, simplifies maintenance, and enhances the overall design of the software system.'''"
